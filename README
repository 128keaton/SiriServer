This is a very early version of a siri server.

We have a new plugin system,
check out the plugins folder and the example plugin for more infos

The file SiriProtocol documents everything I found out about the protocol by now

you need libspeex libflac installed

you also need the python package biplist (easy_install biplist)
you also need the python package M2Crypto (easy_install M2Crypto)

you need to create a certificate and a key file for your domain

place the certificate in a file server.passless.crt and the key in server.passless.key
Just look at Plamoni's https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy scripts on how to create one

make sure to install the CA certificate on your iDevice
