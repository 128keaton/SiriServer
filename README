This is a very early version of a Siri Server.
You don't need any 4S keys to make it work, as it is independent from Apple.
It uses Google Speech-To-Text API. And therefore we are currently limited to 
commands that are shorter than 10 seconds (maybe we can overcome this).

We have a new plugin system:
Check out the plugins folder and the example plugin for more infos.

The file SiriProtocol documents everything I found out about the protocol by now

For the audio handling you need 
	libspeex http://www.speex.org/downloads/
	libflac http://sourceforge.net/projects/flac/files/flac-src/

On Linux simply install it via you packet manager e.g. (or see instructions and note for OS X):
	sudo apt-get install libspeex1 libflac8

On OS X download libspeex and libflac from the websites above (the sources, not the binaries)
and compile and install them, or simply follow the following steps:
	wget http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/speex/speex-1.2rc1.tar.gz
	tar -xf speex-1.2rc1.tar.gz
	cd speex-1.2rc1
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..
	
	wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/flac/files/flac-src/flac-1.2.1-src/flac-1.2.1.tar.gz/download -O flac-1.2.1.tar.gz
	tar -xf flac-1.2.1.tar.gz
	./configure --disable-asm-optimizations
	make
	sudo make install
Note: you can also install libspeex via MacPorts, but libflac is not available in 64bit you need to supply `--disable-asm-optimizations` in configure to make it compile

As this project is coded with python you need a python interpreter (this is usually already installed).
I work with python 2.6.6 and 2.7.2 and both work.

You also need some python packages to make it work:
	biplist
	M2Crypto

You can install both via `easy_install`,
easy_install is available at `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools`,
on Linux you can also get it via your
packet manager:
	sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

After you installed it, run:
	easy_install biplist
	easy_install M2Crypto

We also need to generate certificates for`guzzoni.apple.com` or any other domain
	cd gen_certs
then
	./gen_certs.sh
or
	./gen_certs.sh 192.168.1.1
or
	./gen_certs.sh domain.com
this will generate a certifcaite for `guzzoni.apple.com`, `192.168.1.1` or `domain.com`

When you use Spire, just enter as address what ever parameter you supplied to `gen_certs.sh` e.g.:
	https://guzzoni.apple.com
or
	https://domain.com
or
	https://192.168.1.1

In case you don't have Spire or want to use `guzzoni.apple.com`
you need to setup a DNS spoofing or manipulate you hosts file

Please make sure to install the CA certificate on your iDevice (you can simply mail it to yourself).
It is the CA.pem file that was copied by gen_certs.sh to the servers root. 
In your mail, just click on the certificate and install it.

Now you are ready to go, start the server with:
	sudo python siriServer.py
Note: You need to run it as root, as we use https port 443
(non root can only use ports > 1024) for incomming connections.
